## üí° Creative Prompts

Try combining concepts:
- "Create a ball that changes color based on its speed"
- "Make a spiral pattern that rotates and pulses"
- "Create rain falling with realistic physics"
- "Make a starfield with parallax scrolling"
- "Create a ball that leaves a rainbow trail"

## üéØ Advanced Challenges

For more complex games, build them incrementally:

### Breakout/Arkanoid
1. Create a paddle at the bottom controlled by mouse
2. Add a ball that bounces
3. Create rows of colored blocks at the top
4. Make blocks disappear when hit
5. Add power-ups that fall when certain blocks break

### Tower Defense
1. Create a path from left to right
2. Add enemies that follow the path
3. Add click to place towers
4. Make towers shoot at nearby enemies
5. Add money and upgrade system

## üìù Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "add enemies", say "add 5 red square enemies at the top that move down slowly"

2. **Build Incrementally**: Start simple and add features one at a time

3. **Use Clear Language**: The AI understands game development terms like:
   - "collision detection"
   - "gravity"
   - "acceleration"
   - "particle system"
   - "game loop"
   - "sprite"

4. **Specify Controls**: Always mention which keys or mouse buttons to use

5. **Describe Visuals**: Include colors, shapes, sizes, and positions

## üêõ Debugging

If something doesn't work as expected:
1. Check the browser console for errors (F12)
2. Try being more specific in your prompt
3. Use the Reset button to go back
4. Manually edit the code in the Blueprint Panel

Happy creating! üöÄ
